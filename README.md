# An unsupervided machine learning algorithm for the GRBs classification

The unsupervised machine learning algorithm t-SNE is applied to the entire Swift-BAT GRB sample to obtain a new classification based only on the morphological features of the light curves. The result of the application of the algorithm on the Fourier Transform of the data is a 2-dimensional map in which two groups are shown.
